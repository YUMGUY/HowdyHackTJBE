Egypt@@Abu Simbel@@Abu Simbel is a temple built by Ramesses II (c.1279-1213 B.C.E.) in ancient Nubia, where he wished to demonstrate his power and his divine nature. Four colossal (65 feet/20 meters high) statues of him sit in pairs flanking the entrance. The head and torso of the statue to the left of the entrance fell during ancient times, probably the result of an earthquake. This temple faces the east, and Re-Horakhty, one manifestation of the sun god, is shown inside the niche directly above the entrance. The alignment of the temple is such that twice a year the sun's rays reach into the innermost sanctuary to illuminate the seated statues of Ptah, Amun-Re, Ramesses II, and Re-Horakhty.@@https://www.memphis.edu/egypt/resources/colortour/abusimbel-gtr2.php#:~:text=Abu%20Simbel%20is%20a%20temple,in%20pairs%20flanking%20the%20entrance.@@https://cdn.britannica.com/49/189749-050-EDADDEC0/Great-Temple-of-Ramses-II-temples-larger.jpg
Greece@@Acropolis@@The Acropolis of Athens and its monuments are universal symbols of the classical spirit and civilization and form the greatest architectural and artistic complex bequeathed by Greek Antiquity to the world. In the second half of the fifth century bc, Athens, following the victory against the Persians and the establishment of democracy, took a leading position amongst the other city-states of the ancient world. In the age that followed, as thought and art flourished, an exceptional group of artists put into effect the ambitious plans of Athenian statesman Pericles and, under the inspired guidance of the sculptor Pheidias, transformed the rocky hill into a unique monument of thought and the arts. The most important monuments were built during that time: the Parthenon, built by Ictinus, the Erechtheon, the Propylaea, the monumental entrance to the Acropolis, designed by Mnesicles and the small temple Athena Nike. @@https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404/@@https://www.historyhit.com/app/uploads/fly-images/5164615/Acropolis-788x537.jpg

United States@@Alcatraz@@The federal prison on Alcatraz Island in the chilly waters of California’s San Francisco Bay housed some of America’s most difficult and dangerous felons during its years of operation from 1934 to 1963. Among those who served time at the maximum-security facility were the notorious gangster Al “Scarface” Capone (1899-1947) and murderer Robert “Birdman of Alcatraz” Stroud (1890-1963). No inmate ever successfully escaped The Rock, as the prison was nicknamed, although more than a dozen known attempts were made over the years. After the prison was shut down due to high operating costs, the island was occupied for almost two years, starting in 1969, by a group of Native-American activists. Today, historic Alcatraz Island, which was also the site of a U.S. military prison from the late 1850s to 1933, is a popular tourist destination.@@https://www.history.com/topics/crime/alcatraz@@https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1abbac059a7e6f21ff3aa7e38760a41a48819119/c=0-217-2118-1414/local/-/media/2018/08/17/USATODAY/USATODAY/636701422865855661-GettyImages-632216604.jpg

Ayutthaya was strategically located on an island surrounded by three rivers connecting the city to the sea. This site was chosen because it was located above the tidal bore of the Gulf of Siam as it existed at that time, thus preventing attack of the city by the sea-going warships of other nations. The location also helped to protect the city from seasonal flooding.@@https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576/#:~:text=The%20Historic%20City%20of%20Ayutthaya,of%20global%20diplomacy%20and%20commerce.@@https://cdn.getyourguide.com/img/location/5952b24b75c9c.jpeg/99.jpg

Because of these relics, the cathedral became one of the most important places of pilgrimage in Europe. Its two massive towers have dominated the city’s skyline since their completion in 1880.

After four centuries of active use, the magnificent arena fell into neglect, and up until the 18th century it was used as a source of building materials.

Ecuador@@Equator@@There are two primary reasons to visit Quito, Ecuador. The first is because it is a common departure point for the Galapagos Islands, an archipelago that straddles the equator. The second is to visit the equator itself.

China@@Forbidden City@@Forbidden City, Chinese (Pinyin) Zijincheng or (Wade-Giles romanization) Tzu-chin-ch’eng, imperial palace complex at the heart of Beijing (Peking), China.

It was so named because access to the area was barred to most of the subjects of the realm. Government functionaries and even the imperial family were permitted only limited access; the emperor alone could enter any section at will. The 178-acre (72-hectare) compound was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987 in recognition of its importance as the centre of Chinese power for five centuries, as well as for its unparalleled architecture and its current role as the Palace Museum of dynastic art and history.@@https://www.britannica.com/topic/Forbidden-City@@https://cdn.britannica.com/32/117732-050-9261CFE0/Palace-of-Heavenly-Purity-Forbidden-City-Beijing.jpg

Ecuador@@Galapagos Islands@@Situated in the Pacific Ocean some 1,000 km from the South American continent, these 19 islands and the surrounding marine reserve have been called a unique ‘living museum and showcase of evolution’. Located at the confluence of three ocean currents, the Galápagos are a ‘melting pot’ of marine species. Ongoing seismic and volcanic activity reflects the processes that formed the islands. These processes, together with the extreme isolation of the islands, led to the development of unusual animal life – such as the land iguana, the giant tortoise and the many types of finch – that inspired Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection following his visit in 1835.@@https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1/@@https://travel.home.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/travel/fullset/2014/07/15/91/visiting-the-galapagos-when-to-go.rend.hgtvcom.1280.720.suffix/1491584422518.jpeg

Ireland@@Giant's Causeway@@The Giant's Causeway lies at the foot of the basalt cliffs along the sea coast on the edge of the Antrim plateau in Northern Ireland. It is made up of some 40,000 massive black basalt columns sticking out of the sea. The dramatic sight has inspired legends of giants striding over the sea to Scotland. Geological studies of these formations over the last 300 years have greatly contributed to the development of the earth sciences, and show that this striking landscape was caused by volcanic activity during the Tertiary, some 50–60 million years ago.@@https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/369/@@https://www.thegiantscausewaytour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Giants-Causeway-Story-M.jpg
